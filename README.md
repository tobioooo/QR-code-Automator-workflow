# automator-workflows

Workflow I created for the Automator app on macOS 
to quickly display text,number,email addresses or web pages as QR code for convenient transfer to cell phone. 

Install:
Just open them with the Automator app on macOS.

Usage:

1. mark text
2. Right click 
3. select "show QR code"

The QR code is created by google charts. https://developers.google.com/chart https://developers.google.com/chart/infographics/docs/qr_codes
